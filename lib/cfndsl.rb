  def self.eval_file_with_extras(filename, extras = [], logstream = nil)
    # This function handles the eval of the template file and returns the
    # results. It does this with a ruby "eval", but it builds up a customized
    # binding environment before it calls eval. The environment can be
    # customized by passing a list of customizations in the extras parameter.
    #
    # These customizations are expressed as an array of pairs of
    # (type,filename). They are evaluated in the order they appear in the
    # extras array. The types are as follows
    #
    # :yaml - the second element is treated as a file name, which is loaded
    #         as a yaml file. The yaml file should contain a top level
    #         dictionary. Each of the keys of the top level dictionary is
    #         used as a local variable in the evalation context.
    #
    # :json - the second element is treated as a file name, which is loaded
    #         as a json file. The yaml file should contain a top level
    #         dictionary. Each of the keys of the top level dictionary is
    #         used as a local variable in the evalation context.
    #
    # :ruby - the second element is treated as a file name which is evaluated
    #         as a ruby file. Any assigments (or other binding affecting
    #         side effects) will persist into the context where the template
    #         is evaluated
    #
    # :raw  - the seccond elements is treated as a ruby statement and is
    #         evaluated in the binding context, similar to the contents of
    #         a ruby file.
    #
    # Note that the order is important, as later extra sections can overwrite
    # or even undo things that were done by earlier sections.
